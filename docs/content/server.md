Converge comes with a server that can:

- run `plan` and `apply` and stream the results (using
  [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/))
- serve modules from a given root
- serve the Converge binary itself, for bootstrapping new systems inside your
  network

## Basic Usage

To run converge in server mode with easy configuration, you just need
the binary installed on your device, and a token to use for authenticating over
RPC. In this example, we'll use the `uuid` utility to generate this token.

```bash
TOKEN=`uuid`
converge server --rpc-token $TOKEN
```

This will spin up a gRPC server on port 4774, with `$token` set as the RPC
token. You should see messages streaming from the server.

If you run the server command without `--rpc-token`, then the output will
include the generated token. While this token is valid during the whole
session, a new one is generated each time you start a new session. If you want
to use the same token across sessions, you will need to pass it in.

The next step is to run the converge binary in client mode. This can be on
the same machine, or a different machine in your network. This example assumes
that you have a HCL file called `your.hcl` that you wish to configure the
server or device with.

```bash
TOKEN="the pasted contents of that token from earlier"
converge plan --rpc-token $TOKEN --rpc-addr 1.2.3.4:4774 your.hcl
```

## HTTPS

You can run the server over HTTPS. If you don't have your own certificates, you
can use [certstrap](https://github.com/square/certstrap) to get some with the
following commands:

```bash
$ certstrap init --common-name your-company
$ certstrap request-cert --ip 127.0.0.1
$ certstrap sign 127.0.0.1 --CA your-company
```

Of course, replace `your-company` and `127.0.0.1` with your company's name and
the your server's IP address, respectively (but those defaults will work fine
for trying it out locally.) The certificates will be placed in `out` in the
directory you run the command from.

Afterwards, reference these files like so:

```bash
converge server --cert-file out/127.0.0.1.crt \
                --key-file out/127.0.0.1.crt \
                --ca-file out/your-company.crt \
                --use-ssl \
                --rpc-token your-token
```

You'll also need to pass the `--ca-file` flag to commands like `plan` and
`apply`, in order to trust your new CA (or put it in the system roots.)

## APIs

Using the Converge command-line interface is good enough for most cases. If you
want to integrate Converge into your system in novel ways, however, an API is
available.

### Authentication

Authentication happens with [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/). The only
currently supported algorithm is HS512, and issued tokens must have a 30 second
expiration. Tokens are set using the `--rpc-token` [configuration flag]({{< ref
"configuration.md" >}}) to all subcommands that use the API.

### HTTP/2.0 And gRPC

If you want to create your own client for Converge, you'll probably want to use
gRPC. You can get instructions for your chosen langauge in
[the gRPC docs](http://www.grpc.io/docs/), and the protobuf file is
`rpc/pb/root.proto` in the Converge source. If you're using Go, the client
implementations in `rpc/client.go` are your friends.

When using the RPC interface, the JWT token should be sent in the request
metadata's `authorization` field with the prefix `BEARER `.

### HTTP/1.1 And JSON

A pseudo-RESTful interface is available to do the same things the gRPC interface
can do. See the protobuf file for the most up-to-date endpoints and payload
information.

When using the HTTP/1.1 interface, the JWT token should be sent in the
`Authorization` header with the prefix `BEARER`. You can also set the `jwt`
querystring var, or send it in the `jwt` cookie.

## Standalone Server For The Command-Line

The main Converge commands (like `plan` and `apply`) will take a `--local`
argument (or set `CONVERGE_LOCAL=1`.) This will:

1. Start a local RPC server
2. Perform the requested action against the RPC server
3. Shut down the RPC server

During this process, a port (`localhost:47740`) will be opened and RPC will be
running on it. This interface will be protected with an randomly-generated
token, unless you specify `--no-token`

{{< warning title="Don't Disable Tokens" >}}
Please don't disable token generation with `--no-token`. I know we just said you
can, but don't do it. This will open up remote execution of arbitrary
instructions to whoever can reach that port. You can make this process *more*
secure by specifying `--cert-file`, `--key-file`, and optionally `--ca-file` to
connect over HTTPS.
